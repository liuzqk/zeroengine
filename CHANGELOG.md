# Changelog

ZeroEngine is developed as a multi-package repository. Package versions are
tracked in each package's `package.json`.

## Unreleased

- UI 2.3.0 adds the project-neutral `MVVMViewBase<TViewModel>` integration with
  managed UIView lifecycle; product-specific view models and events stay in consumers.
- EditorTools 1.1.0 adds exact-file byte snapshots with opt-in parent recreation,
  unchanged-file preservation and explicit rollback verification. AssetDatabase,
  scene/Undo and write-authority policies remain with the authoring owner.

- Added root project documentation.
- Added contribution, support, and security guidance.
- Added MIT licensing.
- Normalized package repository metadata for UPM Git dependencies.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.config-pipeline 2.2.0

- Add generation-time typed presets, explicit collection replacement,
  nullable/empty Excel tokens, and complete per-field source provenance.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.narrative 2.1.0

- Add an instance-owned, sequenced quest completion transition event that survives legacy `EventManager.Clear()` while preserving the legacy completion event.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.narrative 2.0.2

- Snapshot active quest runtimes at condition-event boundaries so auto-submit removal cannot skip adjacent quests and newly accepted quests cannot consume an earlier broadcast.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.ui 2.2.1

- Suppress prefab-load failure diagnostics for asynchronous view requests invalidated by manager or session teardown.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.core 2.2.0

- Add injectable log channels, immutable entries, level filtering, and the Unity log sink while preserving the existing `ZeroLog` API and format.

## com.zerogamestudio.zeroengine.core 2.1.0

- Reset registered services during Unity subsystem registration so stale scene instances cannot survive Play Mode entry when Domain Reload is disabled.

## com.zerogamestudio.analytics 1.6.1

- Expose `AnalyticsService.Flush()` so callers can trigger delivery of events
  queued by providers that support explicit flushing.

## com.zerogamestudio.analytics 1.6.0

- Add a durable event queue alongside the existing buffered queue. Durable
  events are persisted immediately and can evict older buffered events when
  the queue is full, so important events survive a crash instead of being
  dropped with the rest of the buffer.

## com.zerogamestudio.analytics 1.5.0

- Split feedback upload authentication from event authentication into a
  dedicated upload secret, sent via an `X-Upload-Secret` header instead of a
  plaintext form field. Falls back to the event secret when unset, so existing
  configurations keep working.

## com.zerogamestudio.analytics 1.4.0

- Retry queued feedback uploads in the background on a schedule, including
  after the app restarts, instead of only retrying within the same session.

## com.zerogamestudio.analytics 1.3.0

- Route feedback upload package names through the configured app id so multiple
  games can share the analytics SDK without POB-specific naming.
- Allow repeated feedback uploads in one process and bound generated feedback
  ZIP size, entry count, log size, and manifest size.
- Keep generated ZIP entry names ASCII-safe while preserving non-ASCII feedback
  text inside the report.

For package-specific changes, inspect the package README, package version, and
Git history for the relevant `com.zerogamestudio.*` directory.
