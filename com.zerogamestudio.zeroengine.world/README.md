# ZeroEngine.World

World and environment systems.

## Modules

- **Environment** - Weather and day/night cycle system
- **Calendar** - In-game calendar and time system
- **Minimap** - Minimap rendering and markers
- **Presentation** - Engine-agnostic camera, occupancy, visibility, and cell stability contracts

## Presentation Contracts

- Camera requests carry stable composition, follow/look target, blend profile, scope, source, and priority identifiers. `SourceId` identifies the stable owner; the lease is the unique request lifetime. A P5 lifecycle bridge owns and releases the lease for its scope, while the adapter/profile resolver maps blend identifiers to engine-specific behavior.
- Environment requests arbitrate profile and blend intent by priority with a stable FIFO tie-break. Their coordinator is bound to its construction thread so project adapters fail closed instead of mutating presentation state from a worker thread.
- Interior occupancy requests arbitrate independently per subject and restore the previous winning interior when a lease ends.
- Visibility requests combine the minimum value within each channel and multiply values across channels, allowing independent cutaway and occlusion owners to release precisely.
- Cell presentation stability is an explicit post-readiness contract and does not change world-cell loading or readiness semantics.

Presentation coordinators are not thread-safe and must be called serially by the owning presentation loop. Unity adapters must marshal calls to the main thread. Change-event handlers must not throw or re-enter coordinator mutation.
